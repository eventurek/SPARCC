SPARCC Semi Passive Algae Rooted Carbon Collection
SPARCC, Semi Passive Algae Rooted Carbon Collection, was crated at Drake University during the Carbon Collection Challenge. SPARCC is a simple device that takes advantage of a contained algal bloom to collect carbon and clean excess nitrates from local water sources. SPARCC was designed to be simple to create and ideally located in a polishing pond, a pond that acts as a filter between agricultural fields and waterways. Currently SPARCC has a limited but promising testing record in Iowa waters. Current plans are to enlarge the SPARCC container to a 55 gallon drum while also adding connected sensors for nitrates and algal growth. 

SPARCC.1 materials:
2 5 gallon buckets
1 ring made from polystyrene foam
3d printed filter holder
cellulose acetate filter


SPARCC.2 is a version that holds a smaller bloom but makes it easier to remove or replace the bloom without removing the larger bucket from the water.

SPARCC.2 materials:
2 5 gallon buckets
1 1 gallon bucket
1 ring made from polystyrene
3d printed filter holder
cellulose filter
